# 🌍 WorldGuide — Travel Planning App (UI/UX Prototype)

**WorldGuide** is a conceptual travel app designed and prototyped using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). 
The project was developed as a final assignment for the disciplines of Software Prototyping, 
Software Development Methodology, and UX/UI Design at Universidade de Sorocaba (2025).

## 🎯 Objective

To design an intuitive, intelligent, and user-centered travel planning app interface, 
with support for interactive maps, AI recommendations, and favorites organization.

## 🧩 Features

- Search for travel destinations and hotels
- Interactive map with points of interest
- AI-generated travel suggestions (destinations, hotels, itineraries)
- Manual or AI-assisted travel itinerary creation
- Favorites system with folder and search support
- Filters for hotel search results
- Responsive and accessible UI (Material Design 3)

## 👤 Target Audience

People with an interest in traveling to different cities, states, or countries. 
No in-app purchases are planned, but the main users are expected to be individuals with disposable income to travel.

## ⚙️ Technologies and Tools

- **Figma** for UI/UX prototyping
- **Material Design 3** for component and layout standardization
- **Flaticon** for icon assets

## 🧪 Design Process

- **Brainstorming** for ideation and scope definition
- **Medium-fidelity wireframes** using Material Design 3
- **High-fidelity prototype** optimized for iPhone 13 Mini
